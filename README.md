# Worder: a word-guessing game

A fun word-guessing game inspired by New York Times' Wordle game: https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle

This project was built using just React, react-spring, and js-confetti (because who doesn't love a bit of confetti?)

The dictionary for the game was sourced from https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt

## How to play:

You can play using your touchscreen device, or with a keyboard and mouse.

You have to guess the word in 5 goes.

Each guess you make has to be a valid 5-letter word.

When you enter your guess the tiles will change colour to show how close you were to the correct answer.

### Examples:

TODO - screenshots

H is in the word, and in the correct spot.

G is in the word, but not in that spot.

F is not in the word at all.
